//Programming exercises for Methods:

//1. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns first five even
//numbers.
mport java.util.Scanner;

public class MethodHomework3 {

	
		public static void printFirstFiveEvenNumbers() {
				public static void printFirstFiveEvenNumbers(int num) {
			  		int i = 1;
					while(i<=10) {
				while(i<=num) {
			  			if(i%2==0) {
			  				System.out.print(i+" ");
			  			}
			  			i++;
			  		}
			  		System.out.println();
			  	}
				}
		}

//2. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns first ten odd
//numbers.
mport java.util.Scanner;

public class MethodHomework3 {

	
		public static void printFirstFiveOddNumbers() {
				public static void printFirstFiveOddNumbers(int num) {
			  		int i = 1;
					while(i<=10) {
				while(i<=num) {
			  			if(i%2!=0) {
			  				System.out.print(i+" ");
			  			}
			  			i++;
			  		}
			  		System.out.println();
			  	}
				}
		}

// 3. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns first seven
// square numbers.
4. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns the sum of a
number.
5. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns the product of
a number.
6. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns the reverse of
a number.
7. Write a method which takes as input as a two number and returns swape of
numbers.
8. Write a method which takes as input as a two number and returns the maximum
of the two.
9. Write a method which takes as input as a two number and returns the minimum
of the two.
10. Write a method which takes as input as a one number and returns the factorial of
a number.
11. Write a method which takes as input as a three number and returns the
maximum of the three.
12. Write a method which takes as input as a three number and returns the minimum
of the three.

Note: output is a set of string so define your output type as “String”

public class Method1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(PrintNumber(5));
	}
	
	public static String PrintNumber(int n){
		String Final = “ “;
		for(int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++){
			Final = Final + “ “ + i;
		}

	return Final;
	}
}
